Əla! Sən dediyin kimi, sadəcə **başlığı** dəyişib, **sənin verdiyin formada** yazıram. Qalan hissəni olduğu kimi saxlayıram:

## **Task Options:**

### **Option 1: Simplified Task – Algorithm Description**

**Describe the algorithm for calculating the equivalent resistance using graph theory.**

**Provide the pseudocode that:**

* Identifies series and parallel connections.
* Iteratively reduces the graph until a single equivalent resistance is obtained.
* Includes a clear explanation of how the algorithm handles nested combinations.

### 🔹 1. Identifying Series and Parallel Connections

**Series Rule:**
If a node connects exactly **two resistors** and no other components, they are in **series**.

$$
R_{\text{eq}} = R_1 + R_2
$$

**Parallel Rule:**
If two or more resistors connect the **same pair of nodes**, they are in **parallel**.

$$
\frac{1}{R_{\text{eq}}} = \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2}
$$

**Pseudocode:**

```text
For each node:
    If degree == 2 and only resistors:
        Combine as series

For each pair of nodes:
    If multiple resistors:
        Combine as parallel
```

### 🔹 2. Iterative Reduction

Repeat simplifications until only one equivalent resistor remains between the input and output nodes.

**Pseudocode:**

```text
while graph has more than 2 nodes:
    simplify series
    simplify parallel
```

### 🔹 3. Handling Nested Combinations

Use **recursive reduction** on subgraphs or inner groups.

**Example:**
If (R1 || R2) is in series with R3:

$$
R_{\text{eq}} = \left(\frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2}\right)^{-1} + R_3
$$

**Pseudocode:**

```text
function reduce(graph):
    if no nested groups:
        return equivalent
    else:
        simplify inner group
        replace with one resistor
        repeat
```
