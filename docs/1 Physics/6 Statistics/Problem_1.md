1.1 Mathematical Foundation (Population Distribution)
Let 
𝑋
X be a random variable drawn from a population distribution with:

Mean: 
𝜇
=
𝐸
[
𝑋
]
μ=E[X]

Variance: 
𝜎
2
=
Var
(
𝑋
)
σ 
2
 =Var(X)

We define the sample mean for a sample of size 
𝑛
n as:

𝑋
ˉ
𝑛
=
1
𝑛
∑
𝑖
=

𝑛
𝑋

X
ˉ
  
n
​
 = 
n
1
​
  
i=1
∑

​
 X

​
 
According to the Central Limit Theorem, as 
𝑛
→
∞
n→∞, the distribution of 
𝑋
ˉ
𝑛
X
ˉ
  
n
​
  tends toward:

𝑋

 ∼N(μ,
