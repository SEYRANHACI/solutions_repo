# **Problem 1: Motion of a Charged Particle in a Magnetic Field**

## **1.1 Electromagnetism â€“ Mathematical Formulation**

The motion of a charged particle in electromagnetic fields is governed by the **Lorentz force** law, which is expressed as:

$$
\vec{F} = q (\vec{E} + \vec{v} \times \vec{B})
$$

Here:

* $\vec{F}$ is the total electromagnetic force acting on the particle,
* $q$ is the electric charge of the particle,
* $\vec{E}$ is the electric field vector,
* $\vec{v}$ is the velocity of the particle,
* $\vec{B}$ is the magnetic field vector,
* and $\times$ denotes the vector (cross) product.

In the specific scenario where the **electric field is absent** (i.e., $\vec{E} = 0$), the force reduces to:

$$
\vec{F} = q (\vec{v} \times \vec{B})
$$

According to **Newton's second law of motion**, this force results in the following differential equation:

$$
m \frac{d\vec{v}}{dt} = q (\vec{v} \times \vec{B})
$$

where $m$ is the mass of the particle.

This equation describes **circular motion** when the velocity vector is initially perpendicular to the magnetic field. The magnetic force, acting as a centripetal force, continuously changes the direction of the velocity while maintaining its magnitude, resulting in uniform circular motion.
