Thank you! From the images and document, it's clear that the main objective is to analyze the **interference patterns** created by circular water waves originating from the **vertices of a regular polygon** (e.g., triangle, square, pentagon). These waves overlap (interfere), producing areas of constructive (amplifying) and destructive (canceling) interference.

### Mathematical Model:

A single point source emits a circular wave described by the following equation:

$$
\eta(x, y, t) = \frac{A}{\sqrt{r}} \cos(kr - \omega t + \phi)
$$

Where:

* $r = \sqrt{(x - x_0)^2 + (y - y_0)^2}$ is the distance from the point $(x, y)$ to the source $(x_0, y_0)$,
* $k = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda}$ is the wave number, and $\omega = 2\pi f$ is the angular frequency,
* $A$ is the amplitude of the wave,
* $\phi$ is the initial phase.

### Superposition Principle:

To compute the total wave displacement at each point, we use the superposition of waves from all sources:

$$
\eta_{\text{sum}}(x, y, t) = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \eta_i(x, y, t)
$$
