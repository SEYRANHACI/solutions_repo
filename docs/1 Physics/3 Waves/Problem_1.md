# **Problem 1: Interference of Circular Waves**

## **1.1 Overview**

The aim of this problem is to investigate the **interference patterns** produced by circular waves that originate from the **vertices of a regular polygon**, such as a triangle, square, or pentagon. As these wavefronts propagate outward and interact, they form distinct regions of **constructive interference**—where the wave amplitudes reinforce each other—and **destructive interference**, where they cancel out. This setup provides insight into how spatial symmetry and phase relationships influence wave behavior.

## **1.2 Mathematical Model**

Each point source emits a circular wave that can be described by the following formula:

$$
\eta(x, y, t) = \frac{A}{\sqrt{r}} \cos(kr - \omega t + \phi)
$$

In this expression:

* $r = \sqrt{(x - x_0)^2 + (y - y_0)^2}$ is the distance from the observation point $(x, y)$ to the source position $(x_0, y_0)$,
* $k = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda}$ is the wave number, where $\lambda$ is the wavelength,
* $\omega = 2\pi f$ is the angular frequency, with $f$ being the frequency of oscillation,
* $A$ is the amplitude of the wave,
* $\phi$ is the initial phase offset.

The term $1/\sqrt{r}$ accounts for the decay in amplitude with distance in a two-dimensional wave propagation model.

## **1.3 Superposition of Multiple Sources**

To model the overall wave pattern resulting from $N$ such point sources, the **principle of superposition** is applied. The total displacement at any given point is the sum of displacements from all individual sources:

$$
\eta_{\text{sum}}(x, y, t) = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \eta_i(x, y, t)
$$

This allows for the simulation and analysis of complex wave interactions in two-dimensional space.
