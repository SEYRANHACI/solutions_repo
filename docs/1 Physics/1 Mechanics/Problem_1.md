# Problem 1
### **Projectile Motion ‚Äì Detailed Description with Formulas**  

**Projectile motion** describes the motion of an object launched into the air that moves under the influence of **gravity**. The motion occurs in **two dimensions**:  

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Horizontal Motion (Constant Velocity)**  
2Ô∏è‚É£ **Vertical Motion (Accelerated due to Gravity)**  

The **path of the projectile is a parabola** (ignoring air resistance).  

---

## **1. Equations of Motion**  

Let‚Äôs consider a projectile launched with:  
- **Initial velocity** \( v_0 \)  
- **Launch angle** \( \theta \)  
- **Acceleration due to gravity** \( g = 9.81 \, m/s^2 \)  

### **Components of Initial Velocity:**  
- **Horizontal velocity**:  
  \[
  v_{0x} = v_0 \cos(\theta)
  \]
- **Vertical velocity**:  
  \[
  v_{0y} = v_0 \sin(\theta)
  \]

---

## **2. Time of Flight \( (t_f) \)**  
The time a projectile stays in the air is determined by the time it takes to reach the highest point and fall back.  

\[
t_f = \frac{2 v_0 \sin(\theta)}{g}
\]

---

## **3. Maximum Height \( (H) \)**  
The highest point reached by the projectile:  

\[
H = \frac{v_0^2 \sin^2(\theta)}{2g}
\]

---

## **4. Horizontal Range \( (R) \)**  
The total horizontal distance covered by the projectile:  

\[
R = \frac{v_0^2 \sin(2\theta)}{g}
\]

üìå **The maximum range occurs at \( \theta = 45^\circ \), where \( R_{max} = \frac{v_0^2}{g} \).**  

---

## **5. Equation of the Trajectory**  
To describe the projectile‚Äôs curved path (parabolic equation):  

\[
y = x \tan(\theta) - \frac{g x^2}{2 v_0^2 \cos^2(\theta)}
\]

This equation shows that the projectile follows a **parabolic** path.  

---

## **6. Velocity at Any Time \( t \)**
At any time \( t \), the velocity components are:  
- **Horizontal velocity:** \( v_x = v_0 \cos(\theta) \)  
- **Vertical velocity:** \( v_y = v_0 \sin(\theta) - g t \)  

The **magnitude of velocity** at any time:  
\[
v = \sqrt{v_x^2 + v_y^2}
\]

---

## **Key Insights & Real-World Applications**  
üîπ **Ignoring air resistance**, projectiles always follow a perfect **parabolic trajectory**.  
üîπ Used in **sports**, **military ballistics**, and **engineering**.  
üîπ Adding **air resistance** makes the equations more complex and the range shorter.
