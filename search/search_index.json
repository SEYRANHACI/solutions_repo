Solving the Equations Given initial conditions: Initial position : \\((x_0, y_0) = (0, y_0)\\) Initial velocity : \\( v_0 \\) at an angle \\( \\theta \\) Velocity components : [ v_{0x} = v_0 \\cos\\theta, \\quad v_{0y} = v_0 \\sin\\theta ] The general solutions are: \\[ x(t) = v_0 \\cos\\theta \\cdot t \\] \\[ y(t) = y_0 + v_0 \\sin\\theta \\cdot t - \\frac{1}{2} g t^2 \\] 3. Time of Flight The time of flight is found by solving \\( y(t) = 0 \\) (when the projectile returns to its initial height \\( y_0 \\) ). For \\( y_0 = 0 \\) : \\[ 0 = v_0 \\sin\\theta \\cdot t - \\frac{1}{2} g t^2 \\] Solving for \\( t \\) : \\[ t = \\frac{2 v_0 \\sin\\theta}{g} \\] For \\( y_0 \\neq 0 \\) , solving the quadratic equation \\( y(t) = 0 \\) : \\[ t = \\frac{v_0 \\sin\\theta + \\sqrt{(v_0 \\sin\\theta)^2 + 2g y_0}}{g} \\] 4. Range Calculation The horizontal range \\( R \\) is: For \\( y_0 = 0 \\) : \\[ R = v_0 \\cos\\theta \\cdot \\frac{2 v_0 \\sin\\theta}{g} = \\frac{v_0^2 \\sin 2\\theta}{g} \\] For \\( y_0 \\neq 0 \\) : \\[ R = v_0 \\cos\\theta \\cdot t \\] where \\( t \\) is given by the quadratic formula above. 5. Maximum Height The maximum height occurs when vertical velocity becomes zero ( \\( v_y = 0 \\) ): \\[ H = \\frac{v_0^2 \\sin^2\\theta}{2g} \\] For \\( y_0 \\neq 0 \\) : \\[ H = y_0 + \\frac{v_0^2 \\sin^2\\theta}{2g} \\] 6. Optimal Launch Angle The launch angle that maximizes the range for \\( y_0 = 0 \\) is: \\[ \\theta_{\\text{optimal}} = 45^\\circ \\] For \\( y_0 > 0 \\) , the optimal angle is slightly less than \\( 45^\\circ \\) , given by: \\[ \\theta_{\\text{optimal}} \\approx 45^\\circ - \\frac{y_0}{v_0^2} \\cdot k \\] where \\( k \\) is a proportionality constant. These equations provide a complete theoretical framework for projectile motion analysis. Would you like further modifications or additional explanations? 1.2. Theoretical Analysis of Range The range \\( R \\) of a projectile launched at an angle \\( \\theta \\) with initial velocity \\( v_0 \\) is given by: \\[ R = \\frac{v_0^2 \\sin 2\\theta}{g} \\] where: - \\( v_0 \\) is the initial velocity, - \\( g \\) is the gravitational acceleration, - \\( \\theta \\) is the angle of projection. Key Observations: Dependence on \\( \\theta \\) : The range is maximized when \\( \\sin 2\\theta \\) is maximized, which occurs at \\( \\theta = 45^\\circ \\) . The function is symmetric around \\( 45^\\circ \\) , meaning \\( R(\\theta) = R(90^\\circ - \\theta) \\) . Beyond \\( 45^\\circ \\) , increasing \\( \\theta \\) decreases the horizontal component of velocity, reducing \\( R \\) . Effect of Initial Velocity \\( v_0 \\) : Since \\( R \\propto v_0^2 \\) , doubling \\( v_0 \\) quadruples the range. A higher velocity results in a greater overall displacement. Effect of Gravity \\( g \\) : Since \\( R \\propto \\frac{1}{g} \\) , an increase in gravitational acceleration decreases the range. On planets with lower gravity (e.g., Moon, Mars), projectiles travel farther for the same \\( v_0 \\) . Effect of Initial Height \\( y_0 \\) : If the projectile is launched from a height \\( y_0 > 0 \\) , range is extended due to a longer time of flight. The range equation is modified to account for this additional height: \\[ t = \\frac{v_0 \\sin\\theta + \\sqrt{(v_0 \\sin\\theta)^2 + 2gy_0}}{g} \\] \\[ R = v_0 \\cos\\theta \\cdot t \\] 3. Observations from Graphs Effect of Velocity: The peak of the curve shifts upward as \\( v_0 \\) increases, confirming \\( R \\propto v_0^2 \\) . Effect of Height: When \\( y_0 \\) increases , the range extends beyond \\( \\theta = 45^\\circ \\) . The maximum range shifts to a slightly lower angle (e.g., \\( 40^\\circ \\) instead of \\( 45^\\circ \\) ). 4. Limitations & Extensions Limitations: Ignores air resistance: In reality, air drag reduces range. No wind effects: Wind can increase/decrease range depending on direction. Flat terrain assumption: Uneven ground alters projectile trajectory. Extensions: Air Resistance Model: [ F_{\\text{drag}} = \\frac{1}{2} C_d \\rho A v^2 ] Implementing numerical methods to model drag forces . Wind Influence: Adding lateral forces for real-world accuracy. 5. Conclusion The range follows a parabolic trend with respect to \\( \\theta \\) , maximizing at \\( 45^\\circ \\) . Increasing \\( v_0 \\) quadratically increases range. Higher launch height shifts the optimal angle below \\( 45^\\circ \\) . Gravity acts as an inverse factor , reducing the range when increased. This provides a solid foundation for studying real-world projectile motion, from sports science (basketball, soccer) to aerospace applications (missile trajectory planning).
