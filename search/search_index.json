The motion occurs in two dimensions : 1\ufe0f\u20e3 Horizontal Motion (Constant Velocity) 2\ufe0f\u20e3 Vertical Motion (Accelerated due to Gravity) The path of the projectile is a parabola (ignoring air resistance). 1. Equations of Motion Let\u2019s consider a projectile launched with: - Initial velocity \\( v_0 \\) - Launch angle \\( \\theta \\) - Acceleration due to gravity \\( g = 9.81 \\, m/s^2 \\) Components of Initial Velocity: Horizontal velocity : [ v_{0x} = v_0 \\cos(\\theta) ] Vertical velocity : [ v_{0y} = v_0 \\sin(\\theta) ] 2. Time of Flight \\( (t_f) \\) The time a projectile stays in the air is determined by the time it takes to reach the highest point and fall back. \\[ t_f = \\frac{2 v_0 \\sin(\\theta)}{g} \\] 3.
